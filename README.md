- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

---

 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas

 Analysis Performed

✅ Data Preprocessing
- Loaded dataset using Pandas
- Checked data structure using `info()` and `describe()`
- Identified and summarized missing values

 📊 Visual Explorations
- Survival count (`countplot`)
- Age distribution (`histplot`)
- Survival by gender (`countplot`)
- Age by passenger class (`boxplot`)
- Correlation heatmap
- Survival rate by class (`barplot`)
- Age distribution by survival (`violinplot`)

## 📝 Final Summary of Insights

- Most passengers were between **20–40 years**.
- **More males died**, while **females survived** in higher numbers.
- **First-class passengers** were generally older and had better survival chances.
- Passengers with **higher fare** had better survival rates.
- Survival was influenced by **gender, class, and fare**.
- The **"women and children first"** policy is evident in the survival pattern.
